            <h2 class="H2"><u><b>Photography</b></u></h2>
            Photography is the art of capturing light with a camera, usually via a digital sensor or film, to create an image. With the right camera equipment, you can even photograph wavelengths of light invisible to the human eye, including UV, infrared, and radio.<br>
<b>The first permanent photograph was captured in 1826 (some sources say 1827) by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in France.</b>
<h3><u>For those who think DSLR Camera is must!!!</u></h3>
Cameras.<br>

Many people today believe that their phone is good enough for most photography, and they have no need to buy a separate camera. And you know what? They’re not wrong. For most people out there, a dedicated camera is overkill.<p></p>

Phones are better than dedicated cameras for most people’s needs. They’re quicker and easier to use, not to mention their seamless integration with social media. It only makes sense to get a dedicated camera if your phone isn’t good enough for the photos you want (like photographing sports or low-light environments) or if you’re specifically interested in photography as a hobby.<p></p>

That advice may sound crazy coming from a photographer, but it’s true. If you have any camera at all, especially a cell phone camera, you have what you need for photography. And if you have a more advanced camera, like a DSLR or mirrorless camera, what more is there to say? Your tools are up to the challenge. All that’s left is to learn how to use them.<p></p>
<h3><u>The Three Fundamental Camera Settings You Should Know.</u></h3>
<p>Your camera has dozens of buttons and menu options, if not hundreds. How do you make sense of all these options? And how do you do it quickly in the field?</p>

It’s not easy, but it’s also not as bad you might think. In fact, most of the menu options are things you’ll only set one time, then rarely or never touch again. Only a handful of settings need to be changed frequently, and that’s what the rest of this Photography Basics guide covers.<p></p>

The three most important settings are called shutter speed, aperture, and ISO. All three of them control the brightness of your photo, although they do so in different ways. In other words, each brings its own “side effects” to an image. So, it’s a bit of an art to know exactly how to balance all three for a given photo.<p></p>

<b><u>Shutter speed:</u></b> The amount of time your camera sensor is exposed to the outside world while taking a picture. <br>
<b><u>Aperture:</u></b> Represents a “pupil” in your lens that can open and close to let in different amounts of light. <br>
<b><u>ISO:</u></b>Technically a bit more complex behind the scenes, but similar to the sensitivity of film for taking pictures in different lighting conditions. Also similar to brightening or darkening a photo in post-processing.
